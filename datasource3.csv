0,Would probably be better if we went and beat them in everything
1,"1980: US boycotted Olympics in the USSR: Result, Soviets won a shit load of medals

1984: Soviets boycotted Olympics in the US: Result, Americans won a shit load of medals 

2022: US boycotts Olympics in China: Result, ???

How about we boycott their products instead? That's the best way to reign in Chinese influence"
2,I'm not sure what that would do to China...
3,Seems like a good way to punish American athletes while doing jack shit to China
4,What’s weird to me is that Beijing hosted the summer Olympics in 2008.  Now they have the winter ones?
5,"It’s really easy to boycott something you don’t do. Ask the athletes, not the fat guy sitting at home."
6,I can firmly say I won't be competing in them.
7,Seems like that would punish the athletes more than it would punish China.
8,"Seems like a meaningless gesture. Everyone else is going to be there, so again, we’ll ~~Jesus~~ just be* painted as the ass holes for not attending. Seems to be a running theme.

I’d rather go kick their ass in competition on their home field."
9,"I wish it was an actual embargo versus athletic boycott, where US companies were forbidden to do business with Olympics.

It would absolutely cripple the games possibly preventing them from even being run, thus sending the strongest message possible. Since the large sporting organizations like the Olympics and FIFA are incredibly corrupt, hurting their pocketbook is the most effective way to send a message."
10,"As a whole, no. If individual athletes want to boycott the games let them. I think it’s best that we simply do better then them at the Olympics."
11,"I mean in theory sure. It sounds like a nice idea.

The problem is if all the Americans pull out, what you're basically doing is guaranteeing that the Chinese went a lot more medals so in a way you're actually arguably rewarding the Chinese with more victory lol.

I think the better conversation is whether China should be allowed to be hosting the Olympics given what's been happening with the opression of people in Hong Kong and the other issues with China of which there are many.

But as far as the Americans just not going. I don't feel like that's necessarily the right decision because it's not really going to affect China in a long term and again all it's going to do is give them less competition to win against"
12,"I had a PE teacher in high school who had qualified for the 1980 games that were boycotted. He talked about it all the time... 25 years later. Bitter.

Don't do that to the athletes."
13,"No, it’s ultimately not worth it. Going to China and racking up a nice medal count would be better."
14,As an American. I'll take a tougher stance on china when our people take a tougher stance one the government.
15,"Nah, that urban decay they’ll get from the games is already a decent punishment. We should boycott their products and moved to get them off the UN human rights council"
16,"History has shown that Olympic boycotts do not work. All that'd happen if we boycotted 2022 is that they'd boycott 2028. Ultimately, I think more tangible resistance is the best way to be tough on China.

Now I think the 2022 Qatar World Cup is a completely different affair because unlike the Olympics, that is directly profiting off of slave labor."
17,No. Think of the opportunity to show them up in their own country? Think Jesse Owens in Berlin or when some people flew the gay flag at Sochi.
18,"Yes I do support a boycott. Hosting the Olympics is an honor. The honor in this case is mainly to the CCP and Xi.

Given the absolutely atrocious way they have acted in the last 2 years, we cannot honor them.

What Xi and the CCP *think* is that we Westerners are a bunch of money grubbing cowards that can be bribed or bullied into submission.

We must show them that this is not the case.

Xi personally must be made to lose face, to lose personal face, to make the Party lose face, and to make China lose face.

He and his policies must be discredited in the eyes of the party rank and file.

We must boycott the games. Let’s just have a winter sports festival at a place where it has been hosted before. 

I’m open to Europe or Canada."
19,No.  Depriving people of what they trained their entire lives for does not alter the course of history.  It's a symbolic feel good gesture at best.   How about we boycott their manufacturing might instead?  You know.  Something they actually care about...  their pockets.
20,No. I’m against Olympic boycotts. The only people who it hurts are the athletes who’ve trained for years and miss out on their possibly one shot at glory.
21,"Lol, as for the preceding 2008 Olympic games in China. China wouldn't care if few countries boycott that, and it wouldn't change anything.

Best way to tackle China would be to stop buying products made in China. But since they produce good stuff for cheap thanks to their human exploitation and we don't care about it, we won't do that"
22,"Are you saying this after that article Mitt Romney wrote for the NY Times?

I think he made a good point in his piece, in that boycotts of the Olympics historically have done little to change international opinions, and just crush athletes' dreams and hard work. Particularly given that we're now essentially in great power competition with China, and our list of grievances is so extensive, it's just untargeted and wouldn't make much of a point.

Really, if we wanted to stick it to the CCP, I'd say that we should let Taiwanese athletes compete under our banner. That and possibly do some pr stunts trying to pin COVID to their early cover up of the disease and censorious media, with things such as socially distancing spectators to our team in the stands (they'd love to have a full house in the arena to show how well COVID was controlled) and athlete speeches about the lives we lost. Do something like all those millennials buying up blocks of seats to the Trump rallies and leaving most of them empty to make a statement and humiliate the host. I know on the stadium filling point we'll likely (hopefully) be past the pandemic at that point, but just say after the early cover up of the disease (among other cover ups by the party), we don't trust the CCP to have everything under control."
23,"Although I do not support what is going on in China and there needs to be consequences, taking away the Olympics for so many young athletes who have dreamt and trained for that over the years is not the right thing to do.  It isn't going to change China's stance and it isn't going to hurt them economically.  It really just hurts the athletes who are not able to compete."
24,"It's a tough call for me....while I agree there should be a boycott,cI feel for the athletes who have given up so much of themselves to train and actually qualify to compete. For some it's their last chance. The athletes should decide their move, we shouldn't make that decision for them."
25,"I wouldn't want to crush the dreams of the our athletes, who work so hard to get on the Olympic team, especially over a political issue. We did it before, it helped nothing."
26,No
27,The Olympics are about competition and not politics and it should stay that way
28,"Yes, if nothing else it draws attention to the issue and forces other western countries to take a stance"
29,Don’t boycott for the athletes sake but only send Uyghur- American athlete attaches
30,Let the athletes compete and leave politics for the politicians
31,Only if there is actual compensation to the athletes of Team USA for the prize money and future earnings missing out costs them.
32,"Yes, fuck the CCP"
33,"I'd be game to boycott the Beijing Olympics, but I'd be more disappointed if that is all we did"
34,Didn't they just have the Olympics a little while ago?  It's all blurring together.
35,"Banning the Olympics is a political statement that says I don't approve of your actions but you can do that with a press release.  It seems that the only people that would suffer are the athletes.

Or am I missing something?"
36,No. Let’s go and win a fuck ton of medals and beat them on their own turf. It’s time we send a message.
37,"No. Not trying to be mean to you specifically but that is a petty and stupid thing to do. You don’t get tough in international politics by not letting people play sports.

If anything it would be way more impactful to let our athletes go and stop everybody like they typically do.

You don’t get the satisfaction of Jesse Owens shoving Hitler’s foot in his mouth if you boycott."
38,Or we could properly restrict their trade instead of putting in poorly introduced tariffs (im looking at you Donald) that put more of a stranglehold on business here instead of at all harming China.
39,"I'm gonna go with the unpopular opinion here I guess and say yes. China is committing genocide as we type. Is boycotting a Winter Olympics gonna stop them? No. But if we are not even willing to refuse to play games in their country do you really think we are willing to do the things necessary to stop a genocide like economically crimpling sanctions and tariffs (for both the US and China because we are too tide to China)? No we are not. Which means we are gonna watch a genocide wipe out an entire culture while we continue to play games and trade with them. 

May our descendants be more forgiving then we are to our ancestors."
40,"At this point, yes.  We're getting into an uncomfortable position that we will not be able to explain to our decendants - ""why didn't you do anything at all?  you kept trading with them, you let them run international events, etc, etc?  why didn't you do *anything*??""

So we don't go to war, but we certainly can start putting pressure on China economically and socially."
41,"I'd support just boycotting the olympics altogether, frankly."
42,Didn’t they just do it in Beijing in 2008? Why so soon again?
43,"The New York Times recently published an [Opinion piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/15/opinion/politics/beijing-olympics-mitt-romney.html) (from Mitt Romney, of all people) about how to boycott the Olympics in a way that isn't actually damaging to the athletes - I found it to be extremely interesting, and not a terrible idea."
44,Of course...
45,YES
46,Id support some countries going to war with china
47,Absolutely. I remember when the Olympics came to Salt Lake City. We raked in so much cash from all the tourism. We shouldn't let China have that right now.
48,"Why don't we just move the Olympics? I know this sounds dumb, but it could be an alternative solution"
49,"Support but unless the issues with China (genocide of the Uighurs, stealing our IP, releasing deadly viruses, failing to follow WTO rules, being the [world's largest carbon emitter](https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/each-countrys-share-co2-emissions) by a factor of 2, etc.), start getting a lot more attention it won't happen."
50,"No, sportsmanship should be different than political quarrel."
51,I'm tired of boycotts and cancel culture. Want a tougher stance on China? Go beat them on their home turf with the world watching.
52,Fuck it let’s have our own Olympics that year with just the states
53,How do you tell all the athletes that have trained their entire career that it was for nothing and politics is to blame
54,Athletes dedicate much of their lives to their sport to make it to the Olympics. I’d say it’s their call on what to do.
55,"No, and I very much on board with decoupling from China by discouraging imports from China. But antagonism on a sport competition? Hell no. 

Cooperation in science research, in space, in cultural exchange, and in sports I strongly support."
56,No. All our athletes have been training too hard to waste their work and potential for petty political differences.
57,No I don’t think America should still be antagonizing other countries in the 21st century just like I don’t think China should keep antagonizing Taiwan in the 21st century.
58,"No, its a meaningless gesture."
59,"Nah, I think that punishes our athletes more than it punishes them."
60,American Athletes should go as a separate thing from America so we can still let out athletes compete and steal medals from them while telling them to fuck themselves
61,Why are we boycotting China?
62,"""I want to boycott China because of what they do to our economy!""

You'd have better results coordinating a boycott of Amazon, the true killer of American industry. 

""I want to boycott China because of COVID 19""

No one's confirmed COVID came from a chinese lab and, perhaps, what you're mad about is the actual lack of coordinated disaster response from the previous president, who refused to do anything at all until it was too late, and then the things he did do, suggested he was further from reality than we'd ever have guessed.

""I want to boycott China because of the Uighurs""

I stand behind this, no one knows what they're doing to the Uighurs exactly but you can guess, it's not good. That said, them being a muslim minority, often makes for strange bedfellows with the let's get tough on china crowd

""I want to boycott China because they undervalue their currency and make it attractive for American industry to leave the USA""

You would ostensibly achieve more results supporting a punitive tax on companies that do this. A guess.

""I want to boycott China because whatever fuckshit they plan to do with Taiwan.""

Well, the USA has gotten more bold with Taiwanese recognition in recent years, so this would be a major statement."
63,No.  Let the athletes decide for themselves whether they want to go or not.
64,[deleted]
65,[deleted]
66,Probably better to find ways to embarrass the along the way.
67,No. Long live the CCP and the great nation they have built. o7
68,"If we don’t do a full boycott, we should at least ban fans from traveling to it. China is banking on the dollars of rich American fans"
69,"Lol the PRC has already said it will sanction any country that pulls this. The US is one of a handful of countries that might not need to fear it, but I don’t think it’s worth wading into over something as inherently shady as the IOC."
70,"Yes. 100% Any suggestions on how we could boycott this would be appreciated. They run concentration camps in China for political opponents and have been brutalizing Taiwan, Hong Kong and Japan as a matter of fact to gain control and territory. Fuck the CCP."
71,"Absolutely and the rest of the world should act in solidarity. 

I don’t give a **** if that means that Americans won’t win medals, or that someone else will win more. That’s not the point. 

The world shouldn’t condone the olympics in a country that is actively commuting genocide, extreme censorship and other human rights violations."
72,"Yes, absolutely."
73,"I don't particularly care about the Olympics either way so whether we win or lose is immaterial to me but a boycott will do nothing to reign in China. Better to rebuild our economy at home, computer hack them every week, and overall take market share away from China."
74,Then china would win more medals
75,We should just beat them at everything and move out manufacturing to Vietnam or back home
76,"As a huge footy fan, I'll also be boycotting Qatar World Cup."
77,Yes.
78,"yes, but for olympic athletes who have been working their whole lives it’s a tougher question."
79,It seems like a pretty useless strategy in my opinion.
80,Yes yes yes
81,"Sure why not, but if its summer Olympics I dont watch anyway"
82,Yes
83,"Nah? I don't watch the Olympics. If they banned Chinese teams from League of Legends Worlds tho, that would be something I'd be for."
84,"Yes for my religious cousins, Muslims 🙂"
85,yes
86,"Yes, we should not tolerate a regime that is actively committing genocide."
87,"Hell yes, but how? And will it be effective? Are some of my main questions."
88,"If we really had balls we’d boycott their products, but I don’t think most of us have the stomach for that considering how prevalent Chinese products are in the American economy."
89,"""Tougher stance"" on what?  It's a sporting event."
90,"yes, but because of what's going on in XJ, not because of anything COVID or sinophobia related.

I've got real life friends I made with huge stakes on ending the sinafication of minority regions of the PRC. good people I like alot."
91,"Yes, I think so"
92,No
93,i would found an independent City somewhere  which has equal representatives of all states and is the only host of the olympics from here on out. lets call it Republican City.
94,"No, leave politics out of the Olympics"
95,"No. It’s not fair to our athletes who trained for their whole lives for that moment, and it won’t do anything to China except let them win more medals. The Olympics is not about politics."
96,"Don't really see the reason to boycott it, tbh."
97,Why does China keep getting the games is the question!? Boycott would be much more effective if we boycott letting them host.
98,Yes.  Idgaf about sports.
99,"Asbsolutey not!

The atheletes have worked hard, some of them for most of their lives for this competiton, and to wreck their dreams for polititcal grandstanding is a huge kick in the face to every one of them. 

Want to make a ""tougher stance on China""? Do something real, like changing tariff laws. 

OH, but that would hurt your big business donors wouldn't it, cant have that! So just sacrfice the dreams of the citizens that don't matter to you. :/"
100,Idk how people would feel safe there since they are literally committing genocide.
101,"IMO boycotts are pretty stupid. If anything, better to go there and humiliate them by winning everything"
102,Technically I've boycotted every Olympic ever because it's boring as shit.
103,No.
104,Hell yeah
105,Would really be missing the whole point of the Olympics so no.
106,"They are spending much less on the 2022 games compared to 08, it's also the Winter Games so it will have less of an impact.  I imagine hopefully by then most of the world will have been vaccinated but I expect the Chinese are already well aware they are going to make significantly less money from the Games."
107,"No, the whole point of the Olympics is that they transcend politics and show that no matter what political b.s. is going on, people still want to connect across borders"
108,"Yes, I think the olympics are dumb. A huge waste of time and money, and a monster of a burden for a city to host. The aftermath is a nightmare (from what I can tell). It needs reworked."
109,"This stuff backfired in 1980. It also helped get the Democrat (Carter) voted out of office.  It did not show America to be strong, it proved Carter could not manage foreign policy.

And then, in 1984 when the Soviet Union boycotted the USA Los Angeles Olympics out of spite/revenge ... it helped show off to the world the USA, and prove what the Soviet government was.  It was a massive celebration for the USA, and the world took our side for the most part.

Boycotting China would similarly blow up in the USA's face.  Show the world we're ineffective, and allow China to prove to the world it is now the new leader in global politics.

Terrible idea."
110,"The Olympics are one of those things that shouldn't ever be touched by politics. It's an important symbol that we can still get together despite our differences, and to be clear our differences are much smaller today than they were at various points throughout history.

So yeah we should go and win"
111,"I wish we would just stop trading with countries that do not follow our labor/environmental standards. Instead we continue to suck China's knob, despite all the BS that goes on there."
112,It would be better to attend and maybe have all those international tourists and athletes let the Chinese population know about some of the things that is going on in their country.
113,"I mean we need to do SOMETHING if we as a world really want to hold to the now hollow sounding words ""never again"""
114,Yes.
115,"No. It would be the definition of am empty gesture. It would also take away the opportunity for hundreds of athletes to compete at the biggest event on earth.

The only thing to do to disrupt China is to cut ALL economic ties. This is pie in the sky thinking though."
116,"No, the 'Games' are supposed to break down political barriers not reinforce them."
117,Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.
118,Fuck china!
119,No. That’s dumb... it’s a sports event
120,I would except for it would hurt the athletes more than China. They shouldn't have gotten it in the first place.
121,yes
122,"No, because I’m lazy as fuck"
123,no. really
124,No. It just hurts the athletes. It’s fucking sports
125,"We should go and beat them in absolutely everything. Also, stop buying Chinese."
126,"Boycotting don't usually end up well, I remember people boycotting Activision Blizzard and yet it does nothing"
127,"I don't just think it should be a boycott on one thing like some silly sports crap. We need to start a full embargo against them and all their trading partners. They're committing genocide, they're annihilating cultural and ethnic groups, they're invading sovereign nations. We should be doing everything in our power to stop them without a nuclear war."
128,Yes it's not like anyone watches those things anyways
129,"Just tell our athletes they get a lot more money or smth, get us more medals"
130,The olympics suck anyways. Why bother.
131,No. It was a bad decision when Jimmy Carter boycotted the 1980 Moscow Olympics.  Let's not repeat that 42 years later.
132,"On the one hand, I’d love it if at least every G20 nation pulled out and embarrassed China. On the other hand, I’d love it even more if they all went and beat the crap out of China on their home field. I don’t know which I would love more."
133,ABSOLUTELY!
134,If the business sector keeps sucking up to China it won't matter what our government does
135,I would support a total boycott of ALL things from China.
136,I'd prefer it if we stopped being so consumerist and giving china all the manufacturing. But what do I know.
137,I don't even watch the olympics
138,Yes. Total embargo.
139,"Well, I don't even see the news and I know China is gonna be in the shit if they keep pushing everyone's buttons.  Refusing the WHO, sinking I think it was 3 carriers, pushing towards Australia, and something else I don't remember off the top of my head."
140,"I don't know if I'd go so far as to organize a boycott but personally, I won't be watching. The CCP is far too comfortable with committing genocide and other human rights violations for me to justify watching anything that China's government puts out until the gross violations of basic rights and come to an end."
141,Fuuuck the Chinese government and their genocide.
142,I would if it was more than just us. If our allies do it with us it would be more of a statement. Otherwise it might just look as if we're being petty.
143,"I can’t imagine anyone would actually have the balls to do this in the first place, and we are rapidly approaching the point where that wouldn’t work anyway, but I would support anything that focuses on the boatload of problems China is foisting onto the rest of the globe"
144,Yes.
145,I think they would be far more hurt if we went and beat their asses in every event.
146,No... avoiding the problem is usually not the answer.
147,"Absolutely. It is appalling to me that the ongoing genocide in China is not being taken seriously in any effective way. To me it smacks of racism and Judeo-Christian bias. Then again, I can think of so many relatively recent or ongoing genocides that pretty well fit this same bill that are also not being meaningfully deterred in any way."
148,Yes
149,No. It really hurts the athletes who have worked so hard to get there. Go there and beat the Chinese.
150,No. Fucking. Way.
151,"Instead of boycotting the Olympics, which should be overhauled completely anyways (I mean, come on. Interpretive dance is being added, but Greco Roman wrestling is still out??) we should boycott all of China’s dealings. 

We could cripple their entire economy by cutting off grain exports, imposing tariffs on their goods, and imposing AND enforcing copyright, trademark, and patent infringement. 

China has decided to bypass the hard work of becoming the world power by resorting to unethical gain-of-function research and outright stealing scientific and corporate information from around the world.

The United States isn’t nearly as reliant on China as people would have you think. Realistically, cheap labor is plentiful. Our politicians allow for this unbalanced system. 

Case and point: 

When covid broke out, China slowed production of ppe, went around the entire world buying up their supply of protective equipment while (still today) hiding information relevant to the origin of the virus despite having no shortage themselves. They did this so they could then resell said equipment back to these countries at a steep markup. 

China can not be trusted with the amount of power they have now. Not to mention they’re putting Muslims in concentration camps. Just imagine if the United States did that after 9/11. The [VERY JUSTIFIED] outrage would go on until every person in power has been replaced. 

The double standard is incredible. How do you like China now, LeBron."
152,I’d be down. Fuck China
153,They're doing Beijing AGAIN?!
154,"No, not at all. The Olympics are largely symbolic, in the context of foreign relations. Actual material impact would be better achieved through more stringent and strategic trade policy like tariffs, etc. Boycotting the Olympics would only serve to engender ill-will on both sides of the aisle, whilst punishing American athletes. Secondary to that, events like the Olympics at their core exist to promote international camaraderie— their proliferation and our participation in them could have the secondary impact of supporting a friendlier relationship between the two countries, potentially leading to the US achieving our goals with China more easily."
155,"No. That would be idiotic. Putting politics in sports has not worked in America, so what the hell would make anyone think it would work in the world, which is a much bigger and harder thing to do?? Politics should not be involved in sports, end of story. 

How about our President and other world leaders grow some spines and force China to do what they should. We are the most badass country in the world, with other strong countries as our allies and could force countries to do whatever we wanted too with little limitation. The only reason our President won't do it is because he has his own interests with China that would possibly go away if he did what was right, and that is probably true for other world leaders as well. 

We police the world, as the most powerful country, it is our job to enforce at the minimum, the most basic of morals. And I could care less about what morals the Chinese do/don't have compared to us, we can and should instill what we all know is right. If people are being treated wrong/suffering, obviously there's a problem."
156,"Not if it forces our athletes to miss out. These people's whole life is focused on these games every 4 years and as with most athletics there is a VERY finite number that most of these athletes will be able to make, and some only qualify once. Let politicians play their little fucking games and theatrics in whatever way they want but if the athletes want to compete for their country then they should be able to."
157,"Wouldn’t do shit. They get money regardless of whether we show up or not, and if we’re not there then there’s less competition for their athletes"
158,No.
159,"I think watching the US beat China on their home turf will be way more embarrassing than a US walkout. I’ll be especially interested in the hockey tournament seeing that NHL players will most likely be competing again. China isn’t exactly a hockey hotbed so it won’t be particularly fair, but it would feel pretty awesome to watch the US beat them by 20 goals or something crazy."
160,Yes.
161,"Strikes me as showy but ineffective...  It'd be pure theater.  That said, I don't really care much either way beyond a general distaste for theater.

It'd also suck for the athletes who may only have one shot to go.

Ideally the olympics would be untainted by politics and corruption, but I think that ship sunk in the harbor a long time ago."
162,I’m not going to any olympics because I can’t afford to. Whatever excuse I can throw on top of that makes no never mind.
163,"I've never understood why anyone gives a fuck about the Olympics.  They are largely athletic games that have small audiences to begin with.  The Olympics themselves are giant financial boondoggles that cities take years to pay off for what?  A few weeks of attention?

Sure, boycott away."
164,Yes. The olympics are overrated and most people don’t watch and couldn’t care less who was competing.
165,"I’ve already been boycotting the olympics because it’s a parasitic, imperial endeavor that takes place at the expense of impoverished people around the world 99% of the time, so yes."
166,I can boycott the olympics without effort
167,"Great question. So far no, but that could change. I'd rather  see the games moved."
168,"As much as possible financially. 

But still send athletes to hopefully beat them at everything."
169,Tbh I don’t know how to boycott that or who would really care
170,"I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if everyone boycotted. After all, Covid started over there"
171,I don’t like giving them money since they have concentration camps
172,"No, but I would like to see it boycotted specifically due to the Uighurs' oppression."
173,"I’m neutral. Olympic athletes deserve to have their chance to shine, and China is really only one of the few countries capable of handling such an event. I’m still sad Japan got stiffed by Covid. There’s another time for politics."
174,"Naw, I would rather watch the USA crush them in the medal standings."
175,It would better to just win
176,Yeah! Fuck the CCP!
177,"Yes! The Chinese Communist Party feeds off of legitimacy. The Olympics just serve as another means to legitimizing their regime and spreading propaganda to foreigners. When a country is so good at controlling its people and hiding information from the outside, I'm sure they'll just create a façade of a pretty city and a high standard-of-living that is actually just an empty shell. They want foreigners to believe China is amazing by putting on a show. This is not just about increasing their image in the eyes of foreigners as much as it's about exerting themselves in the eyes of Chinese people. From this, they are only going to create more propaganda reels of foreigners eating their food and watching the events to spread throughout their country to impress the citizens, further legitimizing themselves. This regime only retains power because they live under the guise of progress."
178,Let’s send our athletes over there and show those communists that we can win in lighter approaches against China too.
179,I don't closely follow Olympic news so it's kind of crazy that they are hosting the Olympics again in the same city when it's only been 14 years since the last one. I see that this one is a Winter Olympics though so I guess that's some difference. Surely there is another major Chinese city they could have put forward to host. Is Beijing even the right climate for this?
180,"I mean, yeah. 

China can go fuck themselves."
181,"Nah, I love China. They have the best food and the best women."
182,"As I ponder this question and formulate my reply, I do so on an iPhone with components made in China. 

My slippers I am wearing were made in China. 

More items than I could fathom in my house were made in China. 

So yes. I would support boycotting the Bejing Olympics, but I recognize the rank hypocrisy in myself and in that stance. I recognize that these symbolic actions are a meaningless salve to our conscience as we are all willing consumers in this inhumane and cruel system."
183,"Nah, let’s go and beat them."
184,No
185,"The Olympics are supposed to be a time to put international rivalries aside, or at least channel them in a more healthy direction, and come together in a spirit of friendly competition. I don't think that would be the correct way to handle China."
186,Anyone who doesn’t do this supports what China does
187,"No, I don't support boycotting peaceful games.  It didn't work in 1980.  It didn't work in 1984.  The athletes would be the ones paying the price."
188,"If we're willing to make a space station with them, the Olympics seems small compared to that."
189,"Honestly, with where the world is right now, neither Tokyo or Beijing olympics should be happening, I'm hopeful that 2024 will actually be safe. 

But after being stuck inside for a year I'll probably still watch, I know not the most logically consistent."
190,Yes.
